             <span>RANCHHOD RAY TEMPLE</span>
            Times of Mahabharata, the surrounding area of Dakor constituted the 'Hidamba' van
            (jungle). It was a very dense jungle. It was pleasant and rich with streams and lakes. It had become an
            attraction for the sages to establish their hermitage for penance. Likewise, Dank Rishi had his hermitage
            (ashram) in this area. During penance Lord Shiva was pleased with him and asked him to demand something.
            Thereupon, Dank Rishi requested Lord Shiva to remain permanently in his hermitage. Lord Shiva agreed to his
            request. He disappeared and left behind him His replica in the form of Ban (Ling), which is known as
            Danknath Mahadev. Thus in ancient times, Dakor was known as 'Dankor' after the name of Dankanth Mahadev. It
            was also known as khakhariya because of many khakhra(palash) trees in the vicinity.

            The present Dakor owes its raison not to Dank Rishi but to Bodana, a great devotee of Lord Krishna. In his
            previous birth, he is supposed to have lived in Gokul and been a cowherd called Vijayanand. On one Holi day,
            all the cowherds except Vijyanand worshipped Lord Krishna. His wife too worshipped Lord Krishna. But
            Vijayanand was proud and stayed at home. Lord Krishna came to his house in disguise of his friend and sent
            him to perform 'Holi' puja. Coming back, he realised that his friend was none else but Lord Krishna. Next
            day they fought a battle of colour. Lord Krishna lost and fell into the river. Vijyanand went after him
            where Lord Krishna revealed his true self. Vijyanand begged forgiveness. Lord Krishna took pity on him and
            solaced him with a boon that he would be born in Gujarat again in Kaliyug after 4200 years as Vijayanand
            Bodana in the house of a Krishatriya and his present wife Sudha would again be his wife, called Gangabai,
            and sealed the sanctum sanctorum of Dwarika Temple for the night. At mid night, Lord Krishna broke open all
            the doors, awoke Bodana and told him to take him to Dakor. Shortly afterwards, Lord Krishna called upon
            Bodana to rest in the bullock-cart and drove the cart himself till reached the vicinity of Dakor. Here (near
            Bileshwar Mahadev on Dakor-Nadiad road) they rested for some time, touching and holding a branch of neem
            tree. He woke up Bodana and asked him to take over. Since that day, this neem tree is found to have one
            sweet branch though the rest of the branches are bitter and it forms the subject of a well-known Gujarati
            song (bhajan). In Dwarika, the Gugli brahmins finding the image missing chased Bodana and came to Dakor in
            pursuit. Bodana was frightened but Lord Krishna told him to hide the idol of the deity in the Gomti tank and
            meet the Guglis. Accordingly, Bodana hid the idol and went to meet the Guglis with a pot of curd to pacify
            them. They became angry and one of them threw a spear at him. He fell down dead While hurting Bodana with a
            Ranchhodraiji (Krishna) directed Gangabai, wife of Bodana, to give gold equivalent of his weight and ask the
            Guglis to return to Dwarika. Poor lady, the widow of Bodana, was a pauper and could not afford doing so.

            <span>KEDARNATH TEMPLE</span>
            Kedarnath is a town and Nagar Panchayat in Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand, India,
            known primarily for the Kedarnath Temple. It is approximately 86.5 kilometres from Rudraprayag, the district
            headquarters. Kedarnath is the most remote of the four Chota Char Dham pilgrimage sites. It is located in
            the Himalayas, about 3,583 m (11,755 ft) above sea level near the Chorabari Glacier, which is the source of
            the Mandakini River. The town is flanked by snow-capped peaks, most prominently the Kedarnath Mountain. The
            nearest road head is at Gaurikund about 16 km away. The town suffered extensive destruction during June 2013
            from the flash floods caused by torrential rains in Uttarakhand.
            Kedarnath is a pilgrimage site or tirtha dedicated to the Hindu deity Shiva. It is one of the four
            pilgrimage spots that form a part of the Uttarkhand Char Dham yatra or Chota Char Dham yatra.[6] The
            temple's construction is credited to the Pandava brothers mentioned in the Mahabharata.[7][8] However, the
            Mahabharata does not mention any place called Kedarnath. One of the earliest references to Kedarnath occurs
            in the Skanda Purana (c. 7th-8th century), which names Kedara (Kedarnath) as the place where Shiva released
            the holy waters of Ganga from his matted hair, resulting in the formation of the Ganges River.[9]

            The Acharyas rebuilt the Kedarnath temple in Uttarakhand under the guidance of Adi Shankaracharya. According
            to the hagiographies based on Madhava's Sankshepa-Shankara-Vijaya, the 8th-century philosopher Adi
            Shankaracharya died near the Kedarnath mountains; although other hagiographies, based on Anandagiri's
            Prachina-Shankara-Vijaya, state that he died at Kanchipuram. The ruins of a monument marking the purported
            resting place of Adi Shankaracharya are located at Kedarnath.[10] Kedarnath was a prominent pilgrimage
            centre by the 12th century when it is mentioned in Kritya-kalpataru written by the Gahadavala minister
            Bhatta Lakshmidhara.
            Kedarnath is located at a distance of 223 km from Rishikesh in Uttarakhand and close to the source of the
            Mandakini River at the height of 3,583 m (11,755 ft) above sea level.[12] The township is built on a barren
            stretch of land on the shores of Mandakini River. Behind the town and the Kedarnath Temple, stands Kedarnath
            peak at 6,940 m (22,769 ft), the Kedar Dome at 6,831 m (22,411 ft) and other peaks of the range.</p>
